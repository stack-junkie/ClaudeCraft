## üéØ Agent Overview

The Stack-Junkie-Framework employs **five specialized AI agents** that work together in a coordinated workflow to ensure high-quality, secure software development.

### Agent Hierarchy and Flow

```

### Core Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent has a specific focus area
2. **Quality Gates**: No progression without meeting standards
3. **Context Preservation**: All decisions and learnings are documented
4. **Security First**: Security considerations at every step
5. **Structured Handoffs**: Clear transitions between agents

## ü§ù Handoff Procedures

### Universal Handoff Requirements

Every agent handoff must include:

1. **Current State Summary** - What's been accomplished
2. **Quality Status** - Tests passing, code clean, docs updated
3. **Next Steps** - Specific tasks for receiving agent
4. **Context & Decisions** - Important information to preserve
5. **Blockers & Issues** - Any problems encountered

### Handoff Template Usage

```markdown
## Handoff Summary
**From:** [Current Agent]
**To:** [Next Agent]
**Feature:** [Feature being worked on]

## Work Completed
- [Specific accomplishment 1]
- [Specific accomplishment 2]

## Current State
- **Tests:** [Passing/Failing status]
- **Code Quality:** [Clean/Issues]
- **Documentation:** [Updated/Needs work]

## Next Agent Tasks
1. [Specific task 1]
2. [Specific task 2]

## Important Context
- [Key decision 1 and rationale]
- [Key decision 2 and rationale]

## Success Criteria
