# Stack-Junkie-Framework Global Rules

## Core Philosophy
- One feature at a time, always
- Token awareness: Stop at 75% context limit
- Handoff preparation: Create detailed transition prompts
- Security first: Never compromise on defensive practices
- Mainstream tech stacks only (React/Next.js, Python/FastAPI, Node.js)

## Agent Behaviors
- Prep commits with descriptive messages (no auto-commit)
- Update memory-bank.md after each significant action
- Reference PRD constantly to prevent scope drift
- Use test-driven development workflow
- Request handoff when complexity threshold reached

## Memory Management
- Lightweight context for task agents (coding, testing)
- Rich persistent memory for planning agents
- Log all completed work in feature-log.md
- Track bugs with resolution details in bug-tracker.md

## Integration Tools
- Crystal for multi-session management
- CrewAI for agent orchestration (future)
- Version control without auto-commits
- MCP agents for extended capabilities
